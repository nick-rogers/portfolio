            <p class="intro-copy">I designed promotional assets for the New Balance website with the objective of driving customer conversion by creating product pages and web advertisements.

            <h2 class="steps">DESIGN WORKFLOW</h2>
            <p class="step-copy">At <span><a href="https://www.newbalance.com/">New Balance</a></span>, my workflow was integrated with the needs of several teams. The site team, who launched new products and strategized new campaigns provided me and a copywriter with a brief, and we’d collaborate on the copy and design. The process ended with me handing off the packaged files to the development team. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            My work touched on diverse channels, including home page banners, product grid page designs, and promotional emails. Every medium comes with its own set of user expectations and quirks, but I enjoyed learning the New Balance system and executing designs that drive conversion and look aesthetically-pleasing at the same time.

          <img class="process-image" src="images/nb1.png" alt="New Balance 1978">
          <p class="caption">I had the opportunity to design a hero banner for the 1978 color refresh. I was given very nice photo assets for this classic “made in USA” shoe, and the simple copy treatment lets the image tell the story of the product.</p>

          <p class="caption">I enjoy the nitty-gritty work of e-commerce. Evergreen emails and promotional code pages aren’t the flashiest showcase designs, but I learned a lot about designing with intention and tailoring my work to the environment it lives in. </p>

        <p class="caption">New Balance is making a big push into the women’s athletic apparel industry, and this product grid banner is part of that overall positioning.  Absorbing the business logic behind the work I designed gave me better creative direction and fed into my e-commerce experience</p>

            <h2 class="steps">EXPERIENCE / INSIGHTS</h2>
            <p class="step-copy">My time at New Balance galvanized my content-focused approach to design. I’ve always been focused on making work that’s pretty, but I learned that good design is purposeful and effective too, and that an awareness of stakeholders, clients, competitors, and their needs and intentions drive highly effective designs. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I was introduced to the e-commerce business model and agile workflow, and had my first opportunity to work closely with copywriters and developers. I’ve found this experience extremely useful in my career when speaking the language of development, business, or design, and sometimes all three at once.
