            <h2 class="steps">OBJECTIVE</h2>
            <p class="step-copy">By 2018 I'd worked on several human-centered design projects, and the HCI methodology of identifying users and exploring their needs and pains particularly stuck with me. With pantry, my research was inspired by talking with my housemates and friends at university. Their unpredictable schedules and intermittent shopping habits meant that their supplies of ingredients were spotty and their food often spoiled. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I didn't have any complete solution at the start, but I’d found a problem area that called for a design solution. To ideate a product, I began by empathy mapping and creating a set of diverse users, whose unique needs and issues helped me design an app that equips users with the means to cook with what they've actually got in their kitchen.</p>

            <p class="step-copy">
              My personas enabled me to identify several key areas of need among the users, particularly regarding the cost of groceries and food waste. My solution needed to address these key pain points, and potentially secondary concerns like dietary restrictions and issues with traveling long distances for groceries. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              My next step was to develop UI solutions to these human challenges. After many iterations and concepts, I reached my ultimate solution, the virtual pantry interface. This interface is the primary feature of the Pantry app, allowing users to record and refresh the groceries and ingredients they have in their home. The adding process is done using photo stock-updating, where the user can quickly scan QR codes of food products, adding them to their pantry, and the removal process is done automatically when cooking or by screenshooting and syncing outside recipes from the web.

            <h2 class="steps">WIREFRAMING</h2>
            <p class="step-copy">The first step in developing a usable interface for the Pantry app was to make low-fi wireframes outlining the interactions that lead users from the home page to the Pantry interface and to their personal recipes page. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            My initial wireframes focused on the connections between the pages and the rough layout of content on each page. I like to improve and assess my design at every stage, looking for opportunities to re-arrange and retool my copy, CTAs and the information architecture iteratively.</p>

            <h2 class="steps">OBJECTIVES</h2>
            <p class="step-copy">Egencia was undergoing a branding transition when my internship began. Egencia is part of the larger Expedia group and the group’s new logo and messaging were being applied to Egencia's assets, and the introduction of additional colors and a new brand treatment titled “under the wing” demanded a new approach for the brand center. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            My role was to create a brand center website that not only reflected the changes to the visual language of the brand, but also served as a hub for useful files and documents, available to designers, marketers, and housing executed designs and mockups provided by external agencies.

            <h2 class="steps">EXPERIENCE / INSIGHTS</h2>
            <p class="step-copy">You can check out the live website here. I valued my time at Egencia a lot. It presented a unique opportunity to work closely with a brand as an intern, and proved daunting but exciting. I learned the inner functionings of a large technology brand, and exposed myself to the complexity which comes with designing for so many platforms, and in so many locales (Egencia is active in 4+ continents). 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The creation of this brand center required me to delve deeply into the potential users of the brand center, and to hone my understanding of every one of the diverse components the brand center would house. I learned about marketing and the assets marketers rely on, and designed materials for sales to utilize at trade shows and on the road. The experience was at once broad and immersive, and helped hone my attention to detail and knowledge of digital brands and how to articulate their message.
