            <h2 class="steps">OBJECTIVES</h2>
            <p class="step-copy">Egencia was undergoing a branding transition when my internship began. Egencia is part of the larger Expedia group and the group’s new logo and messaging were being applied to Egencia's assets, and the introduction of additional colors and a new brand treatment titled “under the wing” demanded a new approach for the brand center. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            My role was to create a brand center website that not only reflected the changes to the visual language of the brand, but also served as a hub for useful files and documents, available to designers, marketers, and housing executed designs and mockups provided by external agencies. 
            </p>

      </div>

      <div class="sec sec-copy">
          <div class="center-copy">
            <h2 class="steps">STAKEHOLDERS</h2>
            <p class="step-copy">There were several relevant stakeholders for the brand center, each with their own unique set of needs and desires. The 5 key stakeholders for the brand center were designers, marketers, sales, external agencies, and the general public. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Some stakeholders needed a more high-level overview of the brand messaging and some needed a quick way to grab a powerpoint template. My design needed to accommodate these all these users.

          <div class="center-copy">
            <h2 class="steps">CONTENT HIERARCHY</h2>
            <p class="step-copy">After getting a sense for what content the brand center would contain, the challenge was in creating an accessible site, where any set of specialized content was available within a few clicks. This necessarily meant prioritizing certain assets over others, namely popular resources like the powerpoint template and critical new content like the “Brand Articulation” section.

        <p class="caption">I started by working with my manager to map out all the existing content that would appear on the brand center, and any new content that was needed. I then mapped out the pages and the buckets of content they would contain.</p>

      <div class="sec sec-copy">
          <div class="center-copy">
            <h2 class="steps">PAIN-POINTS / OBSTACLES</h2>
            <p class="step-copy">The main obstacle I ran into while designing the brand center was the decision whether to funnel different audience groups entering the site or to send all users to the same home page and allow them to navigate to their desired files or information. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The small set of key stakeholders gave us the opportunity to create a more narrowed user experience based on their position within or without Egencia, but after exploring this concept with my team and members of the marketing team, I found that potential users didn’t always know what particular assets they did and didn't need immediately, thus making them decide early in the process to filter their experience wouldn’t be productive.

          <p class="caption"><i>Left:</i> I worked through an audience groups filter for the website would function, and what information could be withheld from each user's site. <br/><i>Right:</i> A site map with different content for internal and external users.</p>

      <div class="sec sec-copy">
          <div class="center-copy">
            <h2 class="steps">FINAL DESIGN</h2>
            <p class="step-copy">After working through and ultimately putting aside the concept of separate audience groups, I arranged the brand center’s content for any potential user. Aside from the home page, there are two two pages on the site, titled “Assets” and “Editorial Styles.” Marketers and copywriters are the principal user for the editorial styles and assets are most relevant to designers and agencies. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I created an image-based thumbnail system for home page, making maximal use of existing visual assets. Lastly, I hosted the site on Frontify, a brand management platform, and launched the site publicly at the end of my internship. The decision to make our site publicly available was made after discussion with the heads of marketing. It allowed for more easy access for agencies, and we’d wanted any members of the public (and prospective employees) who were interested in Egencia to be able to read about our positioning and goals.

I valued my time at Egencia a lot. It presented a unique opportunity to work closely with a brand as an intern, and proved daunting but exciting. I learned the inner functionings of a large technology brand, and exposed myself to the complexity which comes with designing for so many platforms, and in so many locales (Egencia is active in 4+ continents). 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The creation of this brand center required me to delve deeply into the potential users of the brand center, and to hone my understanding of every one of the diverse components the brand center would house. I learned about marketing and the assets marketers rely on, and designed materials for sales to utilize at trade shows and on the road. The experience was at once broad and immersive, and helped hone my attention to detail and knowledge of digital brands and how to articulate their message.
